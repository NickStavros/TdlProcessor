# 1. TdlProcessor
The pilot project for the OMG Template Definition Language (TDL)
# Introduction
The Template Definition Language (TDL) is currently being standardized as an RFC at Object Management Group (OMG), submitted by Jackrabbit Consulting, Inc.
Dido Solutions is pleased to offer a pilot implementation of a TDL Processor named TdlProcessor. This tool allows users to process TDL files efficiently within a structured environment.
## 1.1	Why a Pilot Implementation
Dido Solutions' TDL Processor is a Pilot Implementation rather than a Reference Implementation because OMG has not formally adopted the TDL standard. Unlike some standards organizations that maintain authoritative implementations, OMG does not typically define a single Reference Implementation. Instead, it strongly advocates for multiple, independent implementations based on the published standard to encourage innovation, interoperability, and competition.

As a Pilot Implementation, the TDL Processor is designed to test the feasibility of the TDL standard in real-world environments, gather feedback, and refine both the tool and the standard itself. It serves as an early-stage deployment to identify practical adoption challenges rather than as a definitive benchmark for other implementations. While the TDL Processor is built to comply with the evolving standard, its primary goal is to inform and improve the TDL ecosystem and encourage support for the TDL Specification. It is not a set of unchanging examples of how all TDL processors must be built.

Because OMG encourages alternative implementations, the long-term success of TDL relies on the emergence of multiple tools that adhere to the standard rather than a single reference implementation dictating its behavior. Dido Solutions' TDL Processor embraces this philosophy by providing a flexible, testable, and adaptable open-source platform that evolves as the TDL specification matures within the OMG ecosystem.
## 1.2	Getting Involved
Dido Solutions and Jackrabbit Consulting invite developers, researchers, and industry professionals to actively participate in the TDL Pilot Implementation by engaging with the TDL Processor on GitHub and contributing to the ongoing standardization efforts at OMG. By testing the JavaScript TDL Processor pilot, providing feedback, and suggesting improvements, you can help refine both the tool and the broader TDL Specification or have the basis for building your own products. Your insights and real-world use cases will ensure that TDL evolves into a robust and widely applicable standard.

- Join the TDL Pilot on GitHub: Dido Solutions TDL Processor GitHub Repository
- Engage with the TDL Standardization Process at OMG: Object Management Group (OMG)
- Participate on the OMG: Analysis & Design Platform Task Force (ADTF) 

By participating in OMG working groups, attending meetings, and sharing your expertise, you can directly influence the TDL standard and ensure that it meets the needs of the broader technical community. Whether you are a developer looking to test the TDL Processor, an organization interested in early adoption, or a standards enthusiast eage to shape the future of TDL, your contributions are invaluable. Letâ€™s build the future of structured templating together!
